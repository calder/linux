config BLK_DEV_NVME
	tristate "NVM Express block device"
	depends on PCI && BLOCK
	select NVME_CORE
	---help---
	  The NVM Express driver is for solid state drives directly
	  connected to the PCI or PCI Express bus.  If you know you
	  don't have one of these, it is safe to answer N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nvme.

config BLK_DEV_NVME_SCSI
	bool "SCSI emulation for NVMe device nodes"
	depends on NVME_CORE
	---help---
	  This adds support for the SG_IO ioctl on the NVMe character
	  and block devices nodes, as well as a translation for a small
	  number of selected SCSI commands to NVMe commands to the NVMe
	  driver.  If you don't know what this means you probably want
	  to say N here, unless you run a distro that abuses the SCSI
	  emulation to provide stable device names for mount by id, like
	  some OpenSuSE and SLES versions.

config NVME_VDB
 bool "NVMe Virtual Doorbell Extension for Improved Virtualization"
 depends on NVME_CORE
 ---help---
   This provides support for the Virtual Doorbell Extension which
   reduces the number of required MMIOs to ring doorbells, improving
   performance in virtualized environments where MMIO causes a high
   overhead.

   If unsure, say N.
